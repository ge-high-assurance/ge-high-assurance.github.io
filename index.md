The size and complexity of software that monitors, controls, and protects flight critical products continues to grow. This is compounded by an increased use of autonomous systems which are just as complex, if not more so, since many operator responsibilities are supported and replaced by software in unmanned systems. Further, these systems are subject to cyber-enabled attacks, thereby necessitating another level of complex software to ensure security. 

## About Us

The GE High Assurance Systems research team is devoted to addressing the challenges with design, development, and verification of software-intensive, high assurance systems. Our goal is to develop technology, processes, and tools that result in more efficient software and system development as measured by cost and cycle time. We are based in Niskayuna, NY.
